Compressing & Decompressing Data with Zlib

Zlib module is a core module in NodeJs.It provides compression and decompression using Gzip & Deflate algorithms, useed for network transmission and file storage effciency.

Purpose:
Use to make data smaller and then restore it to its original size

Use Cases:
HTTP Compression: shrink the response data before sending it to the client's browser, which speed up the laoding times
File Archiving: reduce the size of log files or backups before storing them.

Zlib's Methods  (used with both Callback & Streams)

zlib.gzip()         compresses data using the Gzip file format
zlib.gunzip()       decompresses Gzip-compressed data 
zlib.deflate()      compresses data using Deflate algorithm(raw compression)
zlib.inflate()      decompresses Deflate-compressed data
