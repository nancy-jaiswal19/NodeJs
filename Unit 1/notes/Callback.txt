Callback
Callback is a function that pass as an argument to another function
NodeJs uses callback to handle the results of asynchronous operations(like reading a file, fetching data over a network) without stopping the whole program

Standard NodeJs Callback -> Error-first(common asynchronous callbacks)

Syntax:
function(error,result){ ... }

error -> The first argument is reserved for error object. It dedect the error
result -> The second argument holds the successful data

First we check for error before trying to use the data, leading to safer code
