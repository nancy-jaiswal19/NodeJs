fs module provides an API for interating with the file system of the operating system Node.js is running on
This allows you to read, write, update, delete, and check the status of files and directories.

1. Asynchronous

Naming Convention -  fs.readFile
Used - Non-blocking(uses callbacks or promises).NodeJs can continue exceuting other code while waiting for I/O to finish.

2. Synchronous

Naming Convention - fs.readFileSync
Used - Blocking. NodeJs wait until the operation completed before moving to the next line of code.

3. Promise-based

Naming Convention - fs.promise.readFile
Used - Non-Blocking, returns a Promise. Used with async/await for cleaner code.
