EventEmiiter
 EventEmiiter is a built-in Node.js module that lets your code send events and react to evmts.
 It's how Node handles things without waiting(Non-blocking I/O)


Role of EventEmiiter
EventEmitter allows you to emit events & listen to events (asynchronously)



Key Methods
Require the built-in events module and create an instance of the class

Syntax:
const EventEmiiter = require("events")
const myEmitter = new EventEmiiter()


Useful Methods
on(event, listener)         ->        runs every time the event happens (Subscribing)
once(event.listener)        ->        runs only the first time the event happens (Subscribing once)
emit(event, ...args)         ->       fires the eventand call all listeners (Publishing)
removeListener(event,listener)  ->    remove a specific event (Unsubscribing)
