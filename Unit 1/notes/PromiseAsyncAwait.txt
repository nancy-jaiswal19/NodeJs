Promise & async/await

It is primarily used to solve the problem of "Callback Hell" by structuring asynchronous code to look like synchronous code

Promise
Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Promise is like a receipt for async task - you get it instantly and it guarantees you'll get the result later(success or failure).

States of Promise -
Pending        Async operation ongoing
Fulfilled      operation completed successfully
Rejected       operation failed
