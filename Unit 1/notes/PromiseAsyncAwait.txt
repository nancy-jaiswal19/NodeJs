Promise & async/await

It is primarily used to solve the problem of "Callback Hell" by structuring asynchronous code to look like synchronous code

Promise
Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Promise is like a receipt for async task - you get it instantly and it guarantees you'll get the result later(success or failure).

States of Promise -
Pending        Async operation ongoing
Fulfilled      operation completed successfully
Rejected       operation failed

.then() -  Attached the function runs if the promise is fulfilled. This function receive the resulting data.
.catch() - Attached the functions runs when promise is failed.This receives the error object

Chaining - The best feature of Promise is that  .then() always return new Promise,  allow you to chain multiple asynchronous steps linearly, avoid deep nesting 


async()/await()

It a syntax built top on Promises that make asynchronous code look clear and easier to read

async() Function - An async function always implicity return the Promise
    async function fetchData(){ ....}

await Operation -
It is always used inside async function
this pauses the exceution of async function until the promise on its right side settles(either fulfilled or rejects)
If Promise fufils, await return the resulting data
If the Promise rejects, await throws an error, which must be caught using standard try..catch block
